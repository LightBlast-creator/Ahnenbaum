## Executive Summary

The genealogy software market is mature and growing, driven by consumer interest in heritage, DNA testing, and digitised historical records. Market leadership concentrates around three ecosystems:

1. **Ancestry** — largest commercial platform: 60–65 billion records, 3M+ subscribers, 25–27M DNA network members.
2. **FamilySearch** — largest free/collaborative platform: 1.8 billion people in a single shared tree, 22.7 billion searchable names/images, 297M site visits in 2025.
3. **MyHeritage** — strongest international & AI-media platform: 38B+ records, 104M users, 62M family trees, leading AI photo tools.

Below these three, important secondary leaders serve specific segments: **Findmypast** (UK/Ireland), **Geneanet** (Europe), **Geni** (single world tree with 207M+ profiles), **RootsMagic** (desktop/offline), **Gramps** (open-source), and **webtrees** (self-hosted web).

**All** major tools support the core feature set of relationships, photos, notes, and GEDCOM export — the differentiation lies in scale, AI features, collaboration model, and data control.

## Market Overview & Trends

The global genealogy products & services market has been growing steadily and is projected to continue expanding through 2026+.

**Key trends across all reports:**

| Trend | Detail |
|---|---|
| **AI integration** | Automated hint matching, AI-powered storytelling, photo enhancement & colourisation (MyHeritage leads). |
| **DNA-linked trees** | Platforms tie DNA test results directly into the family tree (Ancestry leads). |
| **Collaboration** | Shared trees, real-time editing, and social features for families. |
| **Privacy awareness** | Growing user segment wants self-hosted / offline-first solutions with full data ownership. |
| **Mobile-first** | Companion apps and responsive web UIs are expected, not optional. |
| **Multimedia richness** | Photos, documents, audio/video — moving from attachments to first-class features. |

**Traffic benchmark** (Similarweb, Aug 2025): ancestry.com #1, familysearch.org #2, myheritage.com #3, geneanet.org #4 in the ancestry/genealogy category.

---

## Product Categories

The market splits into four distinct product types:

### 1. Cloud Platforms with Private Trees
Easy UI, record hinting, sharing, less technical setup.
**Tradeoff:** data lock-in risk; exports can be imperfect.
**Players:** Ancestry, MyHeritage, Findmypast, Geneanet.

### 2. Collaborative "Single World Tree" Platforms
Collaboration at scale; connecting to distant cousins working on the same ancestors.
**Tradeoff:** shared editing creates merge mistakes, conflicts, and quality variance.
**Players:** FamilySearch, Geni, WikiTree.

### 3. Desktop Genealogy Databases (Offline-First)
Evidence discipline, local control, advanced charts/reports, research logging.
**Tradeoff:** steeper learning curve; collaboration/sharing is weaker.
**Players:** Family Tree Maker, RootsMagic, Legacy Family Tree, Family Historian, Heredis, Reunion, Gramps, Ahnenblatt.

### 4. Self-Hosted Web Apps
Your own "family portal" under your control — private access, editing, media.
**Tradeoff:** you run the server, updates, backups, and auth.
**Players:** webtrees (open source), TNG (paid).

## Data Standards & Interoperability (GEDCOM)

**GEDCOM** (GEnealogical Data COMmunication) is the universal interchange format for family tree data, maintained by FamilySearch.

### Version History

| Version | Year | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GEDCOM 5.5 | 1996 | Legacy; still in use by older software |
| GEDCOM 5.5.1 | 1999 | De-facto industry standard for 20+ years |
| GEDCOM 7.0 | 2021 | Current standard; better multimedia, UTF-8, `.gedz` zip packaging |

### Key Points

- **All major software** supports GEDCOM import/export (at minimum 5.5.1).
- GEDCOM 7.0 adoption is growing but not yet universal.
- **The media problem:** GEDCOM exports are typically text-only and **do not include photos/media**. Ancestry's docs explicitly state this. A "real backup" is usually: (1) GEDCOM export for structure/facts/sources + (2) separate media folder export + (3) periodic full database backups.
- **Limitations:** proprietary extensions can cause data loss on transfer; multimedia links (not embedded) can break; complex relationship types (same-sex partnerships, non-biological parents) are inconsistently supported.
- **Alternative formats:** Gramps XML (richer but Gramps-only), GEDCOM-X (JSON/XML, limited adoption).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any new genealogy software should support **GEDCOM 5.5.1 import/export at minimum**, and ideally GEDCOM 7.0, to ensure users can migrate in and out without data loss.

## Market Gaps & Opportunities for Ahnenbaum

Synthesised from all four reports, the following gaps exist that Ahnenbaum could exploit:

### 1. Modern UX + Self-Hosted
No self-hosted solution offers a truly modern, polished web UI. Gramps Web is functional but basic; webtrees is powerful but dated visually. There's room for a **beautiful, responsive, self-hosted family tree app**.

### 2. Privacy-First with Collaboration
Cloud platforms have great collaboration but poor privacy. Self-hosted tools have great privacy but clunky collaboration. **Bridging this gap** (e.g. end-to-end encrypted sharing, invite-only access with granular permissions) is a clear opportunity.

### 3. Offline-First + Real-Time Sync
No tool truly nails offline-first editing with conflict-free real-time sync when online. A CRDT-based or similar approach would be novel.

### 4. Multimedia as a First-Class Citizen
Most genealogy tools treat photos/documents as attachments. An app that makes **rich media the centerpiece** — photo galleries per person, timeline-based media views, video/audio stories — would stand out.

### 5. Flexible Relationship Modelling
GEDCOM struggles with non-traditional family structures (step-parents, adoptions, same-sex couples, foster relationships, godparents). Software that models **flexible, typed relationships** natively would address a real pain point.

### 6. Storytelling & Narrative
Beyond data entry, users want to **tell the family story**. AI-assisted narrative generation, timeline visualisations, and exportable "family books" are under-served.

### 7. Web-Native, Zero Install
FamilySearch is web-native but not self-hostable. Cloud platforms require accounts. A **zero-install, browser-based tool** (e.g. via PWA with local storage) or easily self-hosted app is a gap.

### 8. Developer-Friendly / API-First
None of the major platforms offer a real public API for third-party integrations. An **API-first architecture** would enable an ecosystem of plugins, exporters, importers, and integrations.

---

## Key Takeaways for Ahnenbaum

1. **GEDCOM compatibility is non-negotiable** — support import/export from day one so users can migrate.
2. **The "modern, self-hosted" niche is wide open** — combining webtrees' depth with a contemporary UI is a clear winning position.
3. **Focus on what cloud platforms can't do** — privacy, self-hosting, data ownership, offline-first.
4. **Rich media & storytelling** differentiate from data-heavy competitors.
5. **Flexible relationship modelling** is an under-served technical challenge worth solving.
6. **Collaboration doesn't require a cloud** — WebRTC, CRDTs, or simple invite-link sharing can provide collaboration on a self-hosted instance.
7. **Multilingual support matters** — the genealogy user base is inherently international (German "Ahnenbaum" users will often trace roots across countries).
8. **Start simple, export rich** — a clean UI for adding people, relationships, photos, and notes, with powerful export (GEDCOM, PDF family book, printable charts) covers the core use case well.
