# Family Tree Tracking Software Research (2026)

Date: 2026-02-24
Scope: current family tree/genealogy software where users can build relationships and attach photos and notes/stories.

## Executive Summary

Current market leadership is concentrated in three cloud platforms:

1. Ancestry (paid, global)
2. FamilySearch (free, global nonprofit)
3. MyHeritage (paid freemium, global)

Why these three lead:

- Scale signals: massive historical-record collections and high traffic/engagement.
- Product maturity: full tree editing, media attachment, and story/note workflows.
- Ecosystem strength: mobile apps, hinting/matching engines, collaboration, and DNA/records integration.

Traffic benchmark (Similarweb, Aug 2025) ranks ancestry.com #1, familysearch.org #2, myheritage.com #3, and geneanet.org #4 in ancestry/genealogy category.

## Method Used

I evaluated platforms on:

1. Relationship tracking depth (adding relatives/branches and maintaining large trees)
2. Photo/document and story/note support
3. Market leadership signals (traffic rank, records scale, user base where published)
4. Pricing model and practical fit (free vs subscription vs one-time desktop)

## Market Leaders: Deep Dive

### 1) Ancestry

Position: strongest commercial leader for mainstream genealogy and DNA-connected workflows.

Evidence of scale:

- Ancestry corporate reporting cites over 60 billion records, over 3 million subscribers, and over 25 million people in its DNA network (impact report release, 2024).
- In Similarweb ancestry/genealogy category ranking (Aug 2025), ancestry.com is #1 globally.

Fit for relationships/photos/notes:

- App and web workflows support adding family members/relationships, uploading photos, and sharing stories.
- Strong record hinting and paid record access are central differentiators.

Pricing snapshot (US page, captured recently):

- US Discovery: $24.99/month (or $99/6 months)
- World Explorer: $39.99/month (or $149/6 months)
- All Access: $59.99/month (or $259/6 months)

Practical read: best for users willing to pay for the broadest commercial ecosystem and high automation.

### 2) FamilySearch

Position: clear leader for free genealogy and collaborative tree-building.

Evidence of scale:

- FamilySearch 2025 highlights (published Jan 7, 2026):
  - 297 million site visits in 2025
  - over 22.7 billion searchable names/images in records
  - records from 170 countries/principalities

Fit for relationships/photos/notes:

- Full family tree editing with broad relationship support.
- Memories and stories are core functions (photos, documents, written stories).
- Notes are supported; FamilySearch documentation includes practical limits (for example, note length and relationship count limits).

Pricing:

- Free.

Practical read: best default choice for budget-sensitive users and collaborative family projects; tradeoff is shared-tree governance and occasional merge/conflict cleanup.

### 3) MyHeritage

Position: top global alternative to Ancestry, especially strong for international use and AI-enhanced photo workflows.

Evidence of scale:

- MyHeritage 2025 year-in-review reports total records above 38 billion after adding 6.6 billion in 2025.
- MyHeritage About page (mid-2025 crawl) reports 104 million users and 62 million family trees.
- Similarweb ancestry/genealogy ranking places myheritage.com #3 (Aug 2025).

Fit for relationships/photos/notes:

- Family tree creation/editing is core product behavior.
- Photo tools are a major differentiator (enhancement/colorization/animation and related AI features).
- Tree growth through matching/records is strong.

Pricing/freemium structure:

- MyHeritage plans are tiered and promotion-heavy.
- Official help pages show a free/basic tree limit (250 people and 500MB storage) and paid tiers (Premium, PremiumPlus, Data, Complete, Omni) for larger trees and record-saving features.

Practical read: strong choice for multi-country families and users who value photo-centric features.

## Important Secondary Leaders

### 4) Findmypast (regional strength: UK/Ireland)

- Strong for UK and Irish records and research flows.
- Official product pages emphasize free online tree building and easy relative/photo additions.
- Pricing examples from support material (recent): annual Essential and Premium tiers (US examples around $159.99 and $299.99).

### 5) Geneanet (large collaborative European network)

- Geneanet reports over 5 million members, over 9 billion individuals, and over 2 million family trees.
- Free tree tier supports unlimited individuals (per official help), with paid Premium upgrades.

Best use: collaborative European genealogy and broad community-contributed trees.

- Geni reports over 207 million connected profiles.
- Pricing page shows free basic plan plus Geni Pro (listed at $149/year at capture).

Best use: relationship discovery across globally connected collaborative graph; tradeoff is dependence on shared-tree curation.

- Gramps Web project emphasizes browser collaboration, media upload, and full-text search while keeping control of data.

Best use: privacy-first or self-hosted teams/families with technical capability.

## Risks and Caveats to Keep in Mind

- Pricing in genealogy software is promo-driven and can vary by region and billing cycle.
- Record-count claims are not measured the same way across vendors (profiles, names, images, and records are reported differently).
- Shared-tree platforms can create merge/edit conflicts over time.
- If long-term portability matters, verify GEDCOM import/export quality before committing to a single platform.
