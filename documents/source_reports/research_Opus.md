## Market Overview

The global genealogy products & services market has been growing steadily, driven by consumer interest in heritage, DNA testing, and digitised historical records. The market is projected to continue expanding through 2026+. Key trends:

- **AI integration** — automated hint matching, AI-powered storytelling, photo enhancement & colourisation.
- **DNA-linked trees** — platforms increasingly tie DNA test results directly into the family tree.
- **Collaboration** — shared trees, real-time editing, and social features for families.
- **Privacy awareness** — growing segment of users who want self-hosted / offline-first solutions.
- **Mobile-first** — companion apps and responsive web UIs are expected, not optional.

## Data Standards & Interoperability (GEDCOM)

**GEDCOM** (GEnealogical Data COMmunication) is the universal interchange format for family tree data, developed by the LDS Church / FamilySearch.

| Version      | Year | Status                                                            |
| ------------ | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GEDCOM 5.5   | 1996 | Legacy; still widely used                                         |
| GEDCOM 5.5.1 | 1999 | De-facto industry standard for 20+ years                          |
| GEDCOM 7.0   | 2021 | Current standard; better multimedia, UTF-8, `.gedz` zip packaging |

### Key Points

- **All major software** supports GEDCOM import/export (at minimum 5.5.1).
- GEDCOM 7.0 adoption is growing but not yet universal.
- **Limitations:** proprietary extensions can cause data loss on transfer; multimedia links (not embedded) can break; complex relationship types (e.g. same-sex partnerships, non-biological parents) are inconsistently supported.
- **Alternative formats:** Gramps XML (richer than GEDCOM but Gramps-only), GEDCOM-X (JSON/XML-based modern attempt, limited adoption).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any new genealogy software should support **GEDCOM 5.5.1 import/export at minimum**, and ideally GEDCOM 7.0, to ensure users can migrate in and out without data loss.

## Market Gaps & Opportunities

Based on the research, the following gaps exist that a new entrant could exploit:

### 1. Modern UX + Self-Hosted

No self-hosted solution offers a truly modern, polished web UI. Gramps Web is functional but basic; webtrees is powerful but dated visually. There's room for a **beautiful, responsive, self-hosted family tree app**.

### 2. Privacy-First with Collaboration

Cloud platforms have great collaboration but poor privacy. Self-hosted tools have great privacy but clunky collaboration. **Bridging this gap** (e.g. end-to-end encrypted sharing, invite-only access with granular permissions) is a clear opportunity.

### 3. Offline-First + Real-Time Sync

No tool truly nails offline-first editing with conflict-free real-time sync when online. A CRDT-based or similar approach would be novel.

### 4. Multimedia as a First-Class Citizen

Most genealogy tools treat photos/documents as attachments. An app that makes **rich media the centerpiece** — photo galleries per person, timeline-based media views, video/audio stories — would stand out.

### 5. Relationship Complexity

GEDCOM struggles with non-traditional family structures (step-parents, adoptions, same-sex couples, foster relationships, godparents). Software that models **flexible, typed relationships** natively would address a real pain point.

### 6. Storytelling & Narrative

Beyond data entry, users want to **tell the family story**. AI-assisted narrative generation, timeline visualisations, and exportable "family books" are under-served.

### 7. Web-Native, No Install

FamilySearch is web-native but not self-hostable. Cloud platforms require accounts. A **zero-install, browser-based tool** that works locally (e.g. via PWA with local storage) or self-hosted is a gap.

### 8. Developer-Friendly / API-First

None of the major platforms offer a real public API for third-party integrations. An **API-first architecture** would enable an ecosystem of plugins, exporters, importers, and integrations.

## Key Takeaways for Ahnenbaum

1. **GEDCOM compatibility is non-negotiable** — support import/export from day one to allow users to migrate.
2. **The "modern, self-hosted" niche is wide open** — combining webtrees' depth with a contemporary UI is a clear winning position.
3. **Focus on what cloud platforms can't do** — privacy, self-hosting, data ownership, offline-first.
4. **Rich media & storytelling** differentiate from data-heavy competitors.
5. **Flexible relationship modelling** is an under-served technical challenge worth solving.
6. **Collaboration doesn't require a cloud** — WebRTC, CRDTs, or simple invite-link sharing can provide collaboration on a self-hosted instance.
7. **Multilingual support matters** — the genealogy user base is inherently international (German "Ahnenbaum" users will often trace roots across countries).
8. **Start simple, export rich** — a clean UI for adding people, relationships, photos, and notes, with powerful export (GEDCOM, PDF family book, printable charts) covers the core use case well.
