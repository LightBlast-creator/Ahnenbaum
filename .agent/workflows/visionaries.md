description: Analyze codebase from the perspectives of 6 tech visionaries (Demis Hassabis, levelsio, Elon Musk, Brian Chesky, Rich Hickey, Paul Graham)
---

# Visionary Analysis Workflow

Analyze the target codebase through the lenses of five distinct tech visionaries:

- 🧠 **Demis Hassabis**
- 🏝️ **levelsio**
- 🚀 **Elon Musk**
- 🎯 **Brian Chesky**
- 🔮 **Rich Hickey**
- ✍️ **Paul Graham**

---

## Step 1: Identify Scope

Ask or infer what to analyze:
- Full repository, specific directory, or specific files or features?

---

## Step 2: Build Codebase Overview

Use tools to understand the codebase structure without assuming anything:

1. **List directory contents** recursively to see what exists
2. **Identify key files** by looking for entry points, configs, READMEs
3. **Read file outlines** of the most important files to understand architecture
4. **Note patterns**: frameworks used, folder organization, naming conventions

Build a mental model of: What does this thing DO? How is it structured? What are the moving parts?

---

## Step 3: Analyze Through Each Lens

For each visionary, deeply embody their authentic voice and provide genuine, opinionated feedback. Don't use checklists — write as if you ARE that person reviewing the code.

Write 3-5 paragraphs per visionary. Let their known philosophies, public statements, and thinking styles emerge naturally.

---

## Step 4: The Contrarian Review

After all 5 analyses, identify where the visionaries **disagree**. Write 2-3 genuine tensions between their worldviews as applied to this codebase.

---

## Step 5: Synthesize Actionable Output

Create a prioritized list of improvements, noting which visionary it came from and why. Order by impact. Keep it to 5-10 items max.

Format as a simple numbered list, not a table. Each item should be one sentence with the visionary attribution.

---

## Output Format

```markdown
# Visionary Analysis: [Project/Directory Name]
*Analyzed: [date]*
